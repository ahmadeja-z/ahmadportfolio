## 🌐 Routing Note (Important)

This portfolio uses **hash-based routing** (`#/home`) to ensure compatibility with **GitHub Pages**.

Direct path-based URLs like `/home` will not work on reload due to static hosting limitations.

## 🚨 Forking this repo (please read!)

I keep this project **open source** for learning and inspiration.
